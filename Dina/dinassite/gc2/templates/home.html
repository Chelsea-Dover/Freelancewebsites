            As an independent Career Coach, I am passionate about supporting professionals in reaching specific career goals,
                and deriving greater meaning and satisfaction from their work and life. I offer an integrated coaching approach,
                focused on exploring possibilities and achieving greater fulfillment and direction for every client.
                My passion is coaching professionals at various stages of positive transition and change, including career shifts,
                transitions from leave, and other professional milestones.
                As a veteran of Big Law, I started in the litigation practice at DLA Piper in New York, and then spent sixteen years
                at Perkins Coie in Portland.  With over a decade of talent management experience, including as the Firmwide Director
                of Attorney Development, I have coached over 100 professionals in achieving greater integration in the many aspects
                of their lives.  I am a graduate of Colgate University, New York University School of Law, and New Ventures West Integral
                Coaching & Certification Program.
