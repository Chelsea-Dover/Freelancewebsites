                Dina's story
            </h1>
            <p>
                Dina is passionate about coaching attorneys at various stages of positive transition and
                change, including career shifts, transitions from leave, and other professional milestones. Her
                own career transitions have included moving cross-country to join Perkins Coie as a lateral labor
                and employment associate, being the first lawyer in the Portland office to transition to a
                reduced hours schedule, leaving the practice of law to become the first Director of Professional
                Development in the Portland market, and then transitioning to the position she created as an
                internal career coach. In Dina’s final year at Perkins Coie, she was honored to receive the firm’s
                inaugural Diversity Champion Award. This year, Dina has gone out on her own to start GC2, her
                independent coaching and legal talent consulting firm.
                For almost two decades, Dina has spoken widely on a host of professional development and
                diversity topics, including the DiSC behavioral assessment, which she has used throughout her
                career.
                Dina immigrated to the United States from Azerbaijan in 1981 and is an avid world traveler. She
                also serves on the emeritus board of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, practices
                mindfulness and barre3, passionately roots for the Portland Trailblazers, and loves to spend time
                on Mount Hood with her husband, Darren, 16-year old son, Noah, and mutt, Sabine.
