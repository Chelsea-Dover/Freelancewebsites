        <section class="miniAbout2">
            <p>
                As an integral coach, I approach every individual client with a curious mind, open perspective,
                and no pre-determined agenda.  Integral coaching includes every aspect of the client and their
                world - what clients experience now as well as their potential.
                Through coaching, we explore how clients represent themselves, investigate their social world,
                habits, their quality of self-care, and the amount of attention and energy available to take on
                change.

                        With nearly 20 years of corporate experience to guide me, I am passionate about coaching
                        professionals at various stages of positive transition and change, including career shifts,
                        transitions from leave, and other professional milestones. My own career transitions have included
                        moving cross-country to join Perkins Coie as a lateral labor and employment associate, being the
                        first professional in the Portland office to transition to a reduced hours schedule, leaving the
                        practice of law to become the first Director of Professional Development in the Portland market,
                        and then transitioning to the position I created as an internal career coach.
                        For almost two decades, I have spoken widely on a host of professional development and
                        diversity topics.  During this time, I developed and facilitated diversity roundtable
                        discussions with dozens of professionals, creating a safe space to surface sensitive but
                        crucial diversity issues.  In my final year at Perkins Coie, I was honored to receive the
                        firm’s inaugural Diversity Champion Award.

                    <p>
                        I have tried to impact diversity more through my actions than my words.
                        I have not felt compelled to be loud or outspoken, just authentic and
                        sincere in my commitment to the work. Diversity work has provided a ripe
                        field for my natural inclinations.
