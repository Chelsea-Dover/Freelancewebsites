                        What is Integral Coaching?
                     </h3>
                    <p>
                        Integral Coaching is intended to be the most comprehensive way to build competence to face oneâ€™s
                        life situation by attending to the whole person.  The intended outcomes of integral coaching include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>long-term excellence</li>
                        <li>capacity to self-correct</li>
                        <li>competence to self-generate</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Integral coaching addresses four domains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>communication and relationship</li>
                        <li>self-knowledge and self-management</li>
                        <li>environment</li>
                        <li>personal behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Through coaching, I expose my clients to new practices and exercises, which are custom-designed for them,
                        their individual goals, and their unique work environments.
                        Coaching allows individuals to focus on their immediate concerns, as well as their long-term goals.
                        It allows them to focus on self-management, as well as how they lead and influence others.
                        Ultimately, through coaching, clients gain an expanded capacity to take effective action,
                        skillfully self-correct when they find themselves off course, and continuously improve.
                    </p>
